### Topic: Hyperparameter Tuning the Models

### Throughout this project:
1. Data Exploration: Understanding the features.
2. Dealing with Null Values: Few columns have null values, and upon observation, for the numeric columns without many outliers, have imputed them with mean. And categorical column with mode.
3. Data Visualization of numeric columns: Observed that a few columns are right skewed and plan to implement feature transformation to get them to normal distribution. Observed outliers in a few columns!
4. Feature Engineering of numeric columns: Handled the columns that have outliers and applied various transformations to find the transformation that would make the distribution normal. Extracted Outlet age feature.
5. Data Visualization of Categorical Columns: Observed Data cleaning needs to be done for a few columns, and observed which columns are ordinal and nominal.
6. Feature Engineering for categorical Columns: Cleaned Data for the required columns, Label encoded the ordinal columns, and one hot encoded the nominal columns.
7. Applied appropriate Models.
8. Hyperparameter Tuning the models to find the best model.
